This folder contains basic yamls for every guild, named
SampleGuildName-setup.yaml. It is highly encouraged these be used as the
starting point for a new yaml.

Additionally, folders exist for each guild, containing yamls people have
shared, which they use. Use these as references, as you will. 

HerbUser is a nice example of how to use herbs in a yaml.
