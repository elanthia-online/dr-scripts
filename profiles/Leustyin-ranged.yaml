# https://elanthipedia.play.net/Warrior_Mage#Circle_Requirements
# 3 Magics: Arcana, Targeted Magic, Attunement
# 5 Weapons (only 3 are needed to circle): Brawling, Heavy Thrown, Polearms, Large Edged, Twohanded Edged
# 2 Armors (only 1 is needed to circle): Light Armor, Shield Usage
# 4 Survivals: Athletics, Perception, Skinning, Stealth
# 3 Lores: Appraisal, Tactics, Scholarship

# Eventually you will need to train 2 more Magics to circle (for a total of 5)
# However, you will probably end up training them all since they each have very useful spells
# The other Magic skills are: Augmentation, Warding, Debilitation, Utility
