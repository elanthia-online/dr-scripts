# dr-scripts
A series of Lich (https://lichproject.org/) scripts for use in DragonRealms (http://www.play.net/dr/).

To get started, see the setup guide on the wiki: https://github.com/rpherbig/dr-scripts/wiki/First-Time-Setup

Each script has some brief documentation in its header, but better documentation can be found on the wiki: https://github.com/rpherbig/dr-scripts/wiki/List-of-All-Scripts and https://github.com/rpherbig/dr-scripts/wiki/Introduction-to-Character-Settings

If you have some feedback or suggestions, please contact us in-game or [open a pull request](https://github.com/rpherbig/dr-scripts/pulls). We look forward to hearing from you!
