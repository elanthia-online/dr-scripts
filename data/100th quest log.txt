Subterranean Abditory, Hall of the Artifact]
Though spared from the flood that has overtaken the tunnels, this room still suffers from the kind of dampness that permeates the surrounding rock.  Shelves holding rotting books line the walls, which have been carved smooth and square.  Amidst the useless and forgotten artifacts, however, one object is untouched by both time and moisture.  Floating amid this wreckage of knowledge, gently spinning in the precise center of this ancient hall, is a spherical metal artifact.  You also see a carved archway.
Obvious exits: none.

The artifact floats eerily in the air.  Its surface is made of an assortment of various metal plates, including bronze and silver.  A ring of eight copper nodules encircles the device, but only four are visible at a time from any one side.  Flashing blasts of azure and crimson arc between these nodules regularly.
 
One of the copper nodules is pushed in, but still sparks with blue and crimson light.
Three of the copper nodules protrude out of the spherical device, sending sparks of azure, crimson and black flinging through the air.
