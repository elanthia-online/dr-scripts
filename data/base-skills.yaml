# Because the Primary Magic skill is labeled differently per guild...
# In game, you'd type `exp primary magic` to see the rank, but the XML data
# sent and parsed by Lich is the guild-specific label. Therefore, this cross-reference
# helps scripts to determine the correct value to use with DRSkills.getxp('Skill Name').
