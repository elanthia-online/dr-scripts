# Armor remover
=begin 

This is a simple script from the scripting tutorial.
The only thing it does is say "Hi" to someone walking through the room

=end
fput("sort auto head")
sort:
match "armor1", "helm"
fput("inv combat")
matchwait
armor1:
arm1= "helm"
echo "#{arm1}"
fput("rem #{arm1}")
fput("stow right")
goto "sort"
